<h1>Origin of Critical Race Theory</h1>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Critical race theory itself undermines the very people it claims to help. This occurs on multiple fronts. It undermines people's capacity for critical thinking. It teaches people to view the world through racism and sexism (i.e., white males are to blame) and promotes everything critical race theorists claim to be abolishing. It teaches guilt and victim (oppressor and oppressed) mentalities that promote adversarial and divisive social interactions. Critical race theory seeks to consume consciousness so that people are looking for prejudice everywhere (to distract from pervasive corruption in academia and government). It teaches that rigorous scientific method and objectivity are evidence of "whiteness." A "Math is Racist" movement actually exists funded in part by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which literally proves the prejudiced tenets of critical race theory (i.e., nonwhites are incapable of learning high math and only whites succeed). Math and reading are the two areas where many students are falling behind the most. In fact, as of February 2023, a Chicago education report was published stating that not a single student is proficient in reading or math at 55 Chicago schools. Why are taxpayers being forced to fund this failure? No wonder school choice programs are gaining momentum nationwide.</p>

<p>Critical race theorists claim that they are advancing the Civil Rights Act while also claiming that it’s too colorblind and neutral. They contradict themselves and use circular arguments to "prove" racism. (See Kendi's statements below. A circular argument assumes what it attempts to prove.) Authors of the following publications (below) provide statements that are objective evidence of their motives and intentions, yet DiAngelo claims that objectivity is not desirable or even possible. That mentality serves her and academics like her because they are the profiteers of CRT and DEI. Academics are using students as proxies to undermine society while profiting from it and suffering none of the consequences. Meanwhile, students are being psychologically conditioned to undermine themselves via negative emotions (fear, anger, shame, guilt) without developing the skillsets needed to function successfully in the workforce and society. This is detrimental to students. In fact, some employers will not hire humanities majors for technical writing jobs opting instead to hire business or computer science majors because of the differences in attitude that directly impact job performance. 

<p>For example, <a href="work-motivation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Work Motivation in the Rhetoric of Component Content Management"</a> is a case study about employee attitudes and willingness to learn. It follows three employees in a single corporate environment. Two employees come from marketing and computer science backgrounds with no formal technical writing training who flourished in a content management system (CMS) environment whereas the traditionally trained technical writer became resentful about the CMS enough to actually shun it. While this article focuses on the need for educators to emphasize job crafting, problem solving and aligning skillsets and values with business and consumer goals, it actually made the case for hiring employees with business and computer science backgrounds instead of traditional technical writing backgrounds because of differences in attitude. (It reveals which university department curriculums are most steeped in CRT and DEI too.)</p>

<p>In 1995, Derrick Bell published <a href="Bell-Derrick-Who's-Afraid-of-Critical-Race-Theory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Who’s Afraid of Critical Race Theory?"</a> In this essay, Bell says that critical race theory "is often disruptive because its commitment to anti-racism goes well beyond civil rights, integration, affirmative action, and other liberal measures."</p>

<img src="CriticalRaceTheoryAnIntroduction.jpg" alt="Critical Race Theory: An Introduction">
<p>In 2001, Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic published <a href="Delgado-Richard-Critical-Race-Theory-An-Introduction.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Critical Race Theory: An Introduction</em></a>. In it Delgado writes, "Unlike traditional civil rights discourse, which stresses incrementalism and step-by-step progress, critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law."</p>

<p>In 2002, Duncan Kennedy published <a href="Kennedy-Duncan-The-Critique-of-Rights-in-Critical-Legal-Studies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Critique of Rights in Critical Legal Studies"</a> where Kennedy writes that "in the United States, by the end of the 1970s, with the rise of identity politics, left discourse merged with liberal discourse, and the two ideas of the rights of the oppressed and the constitutional validity of their legal claims superseded all earlier versions of rightness."</p>

<img src="IsEveryoneReallyEqual.jpg" alt="Is Everyone Really Equal?">
<p>In 2011, Robin DiAngelo and Ozlem Sensoy published <em>Is Everyone Really Equal?</em> In it they write, "An approach based on critical theory calls into question the idea that objectivity is desirable or even possible."</p>

<article>
<img src="White-Fragility.jpg" alt="White Fragility">
<p>In 2018, Robin DiAngelo published <em>White Fragility</em>. In it she writes, "White supremacy is a descriptive and useful term to capture the all-encompassing centrality and assumed superiority of people defined and perceived as white and the practices based on this assumption. White supremacy in this context does not refer to individual white people and their individual intentions or actions but to an overarching political, economic, and social system of domination. Again, racism is a structure, not an event."</p>

<img src="HowToBeAnAntiracist.jpg" alt="How To Be An Antiracist">
<p>In 2019, Ibram X. Kendi Published <em>How to be an Antiracist</em>. Kendi’s definition of racism and anti-racism in his own words are: "I would define [racism] as a collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity that are substantiated by racist ideas. And anti-racism is pretty simple using the same terms. Anti-racism is a collection of anti-racist policies leading to racial equity that are substantiated by anti-racist ideas." (This is a circular argument.)</p>
